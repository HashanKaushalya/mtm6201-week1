            Hi, my name is Hashan Kaushalya, but I go as <em>'Jason'</em>. I love <abbr title="UX (user experience) and UI (user interface)">UI/UX</abbr> and have a passion to work on that field. Currently I'm a full time student at Algonquin College, following <strong> "Interactive Media Design" </strong> course. My birthday is on the 29<sup>th</sup> of July. I'm from Sri Lanka and enjoying my time at canada and the cold weather.
